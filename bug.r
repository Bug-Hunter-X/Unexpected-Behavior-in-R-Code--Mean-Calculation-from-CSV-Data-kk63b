```r
# This R code attempts to perform a seemingly simple task: reading data from a CSV file and calculating the mean of a column.
# However, it contains a subtle bug that can easily be missed.

# Load necessary library
library(readr)

# Try to read data from file.csv. This file must exist in the working directory or provide a full path.
# If this line fails with an error, check the file exists and that the readr library is installed correctly. 
data <- read_csv("file.csv")

# Calculate the mean of the 'values' column. If the 'values' column contains non-numeric values, this will fail.
mean_value <- mean(data$values, na.rm = TRUE)

# Print the result
print(paste("The mean of the 'values' column is:", mean_value))
