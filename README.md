# R Code Bug: Mean Calculation from CSV Data

This repository demonstrates a common bug in R code involving data import from a CSV file and the calculation of the mean. The bug lies in the lack of proper error handling and data validation, potentially leading to incorrect or unexpected outputs.

## Description
The R script attempts to read data from a CSV file, `file.csv`, and calculates the mean of a column named 'values'. However, it does not handle potential issues such as the file not existing or the 'values' column containing non-numeric data.

## Bug
The original code lacks checks for these issues, which can lead to runtime errors. For example, if the file doesn't exist, `read_csv` will throw an error. Similarly, if the 'values' column has non-numeric entries, `mean` will produce an error.

## Solution
The solution involves adding checks for these conditions and implementing robust error handling.  The improved code validates the existence of the file and ensures all entries in the 'values' column are numeric. If any errors occur, informative error messages are displayed.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have the `readr` package installed (`install.packages('readr')`).
2. Create a CSV file named `file.csv` in the same directory as the R scripts, with a column named 'values' containing numeric data.
3. Run the `bug.r` script to observe the error, then run `bugSolution.r` to see the corrected code in action.
